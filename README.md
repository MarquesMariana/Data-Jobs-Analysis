# Project Overview
 ðŸ“ˆ This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the job market, focusing on data-related roles, to help individuals (and me) make informed, data-driven career decisions ðŸ’¡. Ultimatly, I want to answer the question  "What are the best job characteristics I should look for when entering the data job market?"ðŸ’°.
<br />

Dataset used: https://aijobs.net/salaries/download/

This project is divided into three main parts:
1. Job Stability: Analyse career growth potential.
2. Job Characteristics: Explore how various job-related factors, such as company size, location, and contract type, affect salary.

Power BI dashboard: [here](https://github.com/MarquesMariana/Data-Jobs-Analysis/blob/main/Data%20Job%20Market.pbix).

Targeted SQL queries regarding the questions: [here](https://github.com/MarquesMariana/Data-Jobs-Analysis/tree/main/SQL_Scripts).

Prior to the analysis I conducted a series of queries for famialization and a general view of the dataset: [here](https://github.com/MarquesMariana/Data-Jobs-Analysis/blob/main/SQL_Scripts/0-Dataset_Overview.sql). In this overview I has able to verify that the majority of data was from the US (90.7%), therefore the dataset is strongly representative of the US job market, but may not fully capture global trends.
