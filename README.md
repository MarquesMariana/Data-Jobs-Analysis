# Project Overview
 ðŸ“ˆ This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the job market, focusing on data-related roles, to help individuals (and me) make informed, data-driven career decisions ðŸ’¡. Ultimatly, I want to answer the question  "What are the best job characteristics I should look for when entering the data job market?"ðŸ’°.
<br />

Dataset used: https://aijobs.net/salaries/download/

This project is divided into three main parts:
1. Job Stability: Analyse career growth potential.
2. Job Characteristics: Explore how various job-related factors, such as company size, location, and contract type, affect salary.

- Power BI dashboard: [here](https://github.com/MarquesMariana/Data-Jobs-Analysis/blob/main/Data%20Job%20Market.pbix).
- Targeted SQL queries regarding the questions: [here](https://github.com/MarquesMariana/Data-Jobs-Analysis/tree/main/SQL_Scripts).

# Data Structure and Overview
The Job_database consists of four tables shown below: salaries, ISO_Code, Cost and continents. With a total raw count of 43357.




Prior to the analysis I conducted a series of queries for famialization and a general view of the dataset: [here](https://github.com/MarquesMariana/Data-Jobs-Analysis/blob/main/SQL_Scripts/0-Dataset_Overview.sql). In this overview I has able to verify that the majority of data was from the US (90.7%), therefore the dataset is strongly representative of the US job market, but may not fully capture global trends.

# Insights Deep Dive
## Job Stability
1. Experience Level and Salary Correlation:
- **Moderate Positive Correlation**: The correlation coefficient of 0.2984 indicates a moderate positive relationship between experience and salary. While experience contributes to salary growth, other factors such as industry specialization also play a role.
- **Executive vs Entry-Level Salary Gap**: Executives earn almost twice the salary of entry-level professionals, highlighting the increased responsibilities, leadership, and strategic decision-making expected at higher levels.
- **Consistent Salary Range**: The minimum salary across all experience levels is about 15,000, while the maximum ranges between 609 million and 800 million. This suggests that even lower-experience professionals can achieve high earnings, and not all senior professionals earn the highest salaries.
- **Skewed Salary Averages**: The median salary is consistently lower than the average across experience levels, indicating that high-salary outliers significantly skew the overall average. This is particularly evident in entry- and mid-level roles, where a few high-paying jobs inflate overall salary expectations.
